# LESS TextMate bundle

Syntax highlighting for `.less` files. To learn more about [LESS][], see <http://lesscss.org>.

This bundle is similar to `appden/less.tmbundle` but requires `node` (and `less` to be installed in `node_modules`)


## Saving to CSS (âŒ˜S)

Runs `less.render()` on the current file, saving to the same file name with a .css extension (e.g. style.less => style.css). 


## TextMate 2 Alpha Install

This bundle should work in the TM2 alpha. If you run into path errors, try adding the following to your `~/.tm_properties` file:

    PATH = "$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin"
    NODE_PATH = "$NODE_PATH:/usr/local/lib/node_modules"
